# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:
To Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App

## Algorithm:
1.Select and Compare 2–3 Competitor Apps/Websites

2.Perform Heuristic Evaluation

3.Analyze and Document Findings

4.Propose and Apply Improvements

## Procedure

1.Use both apps (YouTube and Spotify) separately and document their usability under heuristics.

2.Compare visibility, control, consistency, aesthetics, and feedback features.

3.Note overlaps (recommendations, playlists, trending).

4.Identify gaps where one app can complement the other.

5.Create an interlinked conceptual workflow:

   YouTube → discovery stage.

   Spotify → immersive listening stage.

  Feedback loop → user returns to YouTube for visuals/live content.
  
6.The interlinked concept of YouTube and Spotify merges YouTube’s powerful discovery and community interaction with Spotify’s minimalist, personalized listening, creating a continuous cycle of discovering, engaging, and enjoying music in one unified ecosystem.

7.Suggest improvements such as cross-platform sync (playlist + history integration).
